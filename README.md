# Algorithms

Some algorithms written in JS. The root index.js file exports all the algorithms. The test directory contains some large files of >50mb used for testing.

- Divide & Conquer
  - Merge sort - Sorts an array of plain integers using merge sort.
  - Count inversions - Counts inversions and returns a sorted array using merge sort.
  - Quick sort - Sorts an array of plain integers using quick sort.
  - Karger's algorithm - Returns the min cut for an undirected graph.
- Graphs
  - Strongly connected components - return an array of n number of strongly connected components, ordered by size.

The only dependency is the test runner Ava. Tests can be run with `npm run test`.
